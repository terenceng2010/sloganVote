# Slogan Vote
Realtime Slogan Voting for assembly (i.e public protest, gathering or public promotion of an association)

## Why
Currently, participants of an assembly have a hard time to push their own slogan and shout together.
They may only shout slogans provided by the host as the result.
This limits the variety of slogan In an assembly. 

Inspired from Team Fortress 2 voting feature. https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Voting , I think that it is time for participant
to have more variety in an assembly.

## How to Use
TBD

## What it uses
* React Native (client)
* Meteor (server)

## Limitation
* The current implementation show slogans sort by their number of votes only. I hope to make it more like the one in TF2
* user record is not yet added.
